# Developing Operating System in C

The goal of the project is to gain hands-on experience in building an operating system from scratch. Through the development of this project, I hope to gain a better understading of the inner workings of an operating system and the various components that make it up.

## How I Will Approach the Project

1. Research the architecture of operating systems and their components. 
      * I am hoping this will give me a clear understanding of the different aspects of an operating system as well as how they work together.
      
2. Choose how I will write the code for my operating system as well as the necessary requirements I will need:
      * IDE
      * VirtualBox
      * etc.

3. Decide on the features I want to include in the operating system.
      * Memory management
      * Process management 
      * File system
      
4. Write the code for the basic components of the operating system.
      * Bootloader
      * Kernel
      * System calls
      
5. Test and debug the operating system to make sure it works properly and is stable.

6. Improve and expand the features of the operating system based on my own interests.

7. Documentation. Documenting my code and the design of the operating system to help others understand how it works.
      * Written explanations
      * Flowcharts
      * Block diagrams
